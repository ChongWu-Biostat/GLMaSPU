Description: Several tests for high dimensional generalized linear models have been proposed recently. In this package, we implemented a new test called aSPU for high dimensional generalized linear models, which is often more powerful than the existing methods in a wide scenarios. We also implemented permutation based version of several existing methods for research purpose. We recommend users use the aSPU test for their real testing problem.
